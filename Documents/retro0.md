# Mad
Things that slowed process:
- Docker caching issues
- Time limitations during the sprint
- Docker Compose setup longer than expected
  - This should improve as everyone has more time and experience

# Sad 
Things that didn't go as planned:
- Not everyone could attend all meetings
- Daily meetins scheduled to close to the meeting time
- Overlapping schedules made coordination challenging

# Glad
Things that went well and are worth continuing:
- Working demo
- Production environment ready on time
- Strong teamwork
- Tasks stayed on schedule
- Pair programming was effective
- Issues solved together
- Discord worked well as our main communication platform

# Learnings and improvements 
- The first sprint was an important learning experience
- Daily meetings should be scheduled in advance, during the previous dily
- Better planning will help improve scheduling conflicts
