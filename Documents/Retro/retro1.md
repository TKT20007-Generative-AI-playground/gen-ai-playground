# Start
- start doing more pull requests
- start having more people do pull request reviews
- start deleting branches we don't user anymore
- start having better communication about when people are busy so we have enough time to finish our work on time 
- start having everyone work on their own branches
- start telling others when you've finished working on something

# Stop
- no copying from branches that are not ready
- stop leaving things to the last minute

# Continue
- continue deciding on when to meet ahead of time
- continue keeping the backlog up to date
- continue asking for help when needed
- continue having a scrum master each sprint
- continue pair coding

# What we want to improve on this sprint
- we want to everyone to start working on their own branches and not copy from ones that are not finished
- we want to start doing more pull requests and have them reviewed more actively
- we want to continue having a scrum master who makes sure meetings are decided on ahead of time and that the backlog is kept up to date
